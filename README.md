Hello github!

A simple, time honored tradition. 

I used this repo to setup Git within PyCharm. 

Useful Tips : Once you commit a file (Cntrl/CMD+K) you then will need to push (Cntrol/CMD+Shift+K) in order to make those commits live on GitHub. (You should have known that, though.)

That's all. Have a nice day!
